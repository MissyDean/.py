Question 1
Write a function to print "hello_USERNAME!" USERNAME is the input of the function. The first line of the code has been defined as below.

    def hello_name(user_name):
    print("hello_"+user_name)
user_name = input('hello_USERNAME! ')
hello_name(user_name)
                
Question 2
Write a python function, first_odds that prints the odd numbers from 1-100 and returns nothing

    def first_odds():
         for i in range(1,101):
        if i % 2 != 0:
            print(i)
    first_odd()
                
Question 3
Please write a Python function, max_num_in_list to return the max number of a given list. The first line of the code has been defined as below.

    def max_num_in_list(a_list):
           maximum = a_list[0]
    for i in range(len(a_list)):
        if a_list[i] > maximum:
            maximum = a_list[i]
    return maximum
a_list = [20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
print(max_num_in_list(a_list))
                
Question 4
Write a function to return if the given year is a leap year. A leap year is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400. The return should be boolean Type (true/false).

    def is_leap_year(a_year):
    if(a_year % 400 == 0):
        return True
    elif a_year % 100 == 0:
        return False
    
    elif a_year%4 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
a_year = int(input())
print(is_leap_year(a_year))
                
Question 5
Write a function to check to see if all numbers in list are consecutive numbers. For example, [2,3,4,5,6,7] are consecutive numbers, but [1,2,4,5] are not consecutive numbers. The return should be boolean Type.

    def is_consecutive(a_list):
    return sorted(a_list) == list(range(min(a_list), max(a_list)+1))
  a_list = [2,3,4,5,6,7]
print(is_consecutive(a_list))
  a_list = [1,2,4,5]
print(is_consecutive(a_list))
